# CASE STUDY: SEAT TEMPERATURE CONTROL USING AVR PROGRAMMING(Atmegha 328)
# Activity 1 - 
#               1.To monitor whether the seat is occupied or not
#               2.To check the status of heater 
#               3.Indicate it using LED actuator
#Simulation results for various input conditions
# Condition 1- Seat has not been occupied and also heater is off
